## The Game
The game is okay at best. It isn't very fun and gets boring fast, but it is useful for training quick mental math.

## Improvements to be made
* Styling (Especially the input text)

## Conclusion
It was a somewhat fun project but I'm glad that I did it. I learned a bit more about navigation and react native in general. It was especially useful to learn how to dismiss 
a numeric keyboard from the screen (at least for iOS)
